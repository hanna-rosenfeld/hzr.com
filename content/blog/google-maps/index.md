Something I find rather usefull is to create custom maps through google. Check out my map of places to go in the USA.
My husband and I have taken a roadtrip from coast to coast in 3 weeks last year and filled with nostalgia in the times of covid, i sat down and made a map that will be usefull for my future travel planning.
